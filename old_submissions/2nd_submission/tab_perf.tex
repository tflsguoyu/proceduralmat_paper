	\caption{\label{fig:performance}
		Performance statistics for our optimization-based point estimate as well as HMC-based posterior sampling.
		The numbers are collected by drawing 20k samples using a workstation equipped with an Intel i7-6800K six-core CPU and an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. 
		The optimization involves one forward evaluation (and backpropagation) per iteration; while the HMC takes ten per sample on average\protect\footnotemark.

\footnotetext{In HMC sampling, each sample needs $(s+3)/r$ forward evaluations on average where $s$ indicates the number of leapfrog steps and $r$ denotes the acceptance rate. In practice, we set $s = 4$ and have $r = 70\%$, causing the expected number of evaluations per sample to be 10.}
