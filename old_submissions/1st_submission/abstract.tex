We explore the problem of estimating the parameters of various material models, spanning a range of optical phenomena: from simple opaque bumpy dielectrics (e.g. plastics or wall paints), through anisotropic brushed metals and metallic paints, to scattering media (e.g. milk). Unlike methods that estimate the parameters of a standard BRDF model separately per pixel, we take a different approach of estimating a smaller number of \emph{global} material parameters. We resolve two main challenges for parameter estimation in such material models. We address the problem of discovering similarity structures in parameter space by a Bayesian inference approach using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of the space of plausible material parameters, instead of finding just a point estimate of the parameter vector. We also introduce a framework where image \emph{summary functions} address the loss function design problem. Our estimated material models can cover large areas without repetition, can be easily edited, and require minimal storage.
